# Hints and Tips :tada:

1. We're going to be dealing with service workers, as this week is all about providing native mobile app functionality like offline mode to our online web apps.

1. The latest activity is going to be the most important in understanding how to do this homework.

1. We're also going to need to setup a lot of our service-worker boilerplate as it's not currently provided for us.
   > Same with files such as the manifest etc

# Submission Checklist :rocket:

1. Your folder structure should resemeble that which is provided in the HINTS.md file, which itself resembles the structure we used with MVC.

1. Ensure that you submit both a link to your homework repo and it should be deployed on Heroku, **including the MongoDB database**!

   > See the Supplemental Folder in order to figure this out, we need to add this like we do with JAWS_DB for MySQL.

1. Ensure what you've submitted works when you grade it yourself against the:

   - The user stories provided
   - The acceptance criterias provided.
   - The business context provided.

1. Make sure your homework repo has a quality README that _you_ have written, and provide screenshots

1. Commit after most changes, all that code doesn't just appear first time :wink:

1. **Comment that JavaScript code :pray:**
